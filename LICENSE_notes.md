#### Data I Used

My use of the American Presidency Project's transcripts of the 2016 presidential election debates and my distribution of modified version of this data I created myself falls under "fair use" as it is for purposes of scholarship and educational purposes for my Data Science class at the University of Pittsburgh.

#### My Licensing Terms

The modified dataset I created and annotated is covered by the CC-BY-NC 4.0 license. I chose this license so that I would be attributed for the work I did to collect and clean this dataset. Additionally, it requires that my dataset cannot be used for commercial purposes which I feel is appropriate given its political subject matter. I would prefer if my dataset were to be used for other scholarship, research or educational purposes.
