#### Data I Used

My use of the American Presidency Project's transcripts of the 2016 presidential election debates and my distribution of modified version of this data I created myself falls under "fair use" as it is for purposes of scholarship and educational purposes for my Data Science class at the University of Pittsburgh.

#### My Licensing Terms

The modified dataset I created and annotated is covered by the CC-BY-NC 4.0 license. I chose this license so that I would be attributed for the work I did to collect and clean this dataset. Additionally, it requires that my dataset cannot be used for commercial purposes which I feel is appropriate given its political subject matter. I would prefer if my dataset were to be used for other scholarship, research or educational purposes.

For my code, I did a lot of work to clean up the transcripts and edit the NER trees. If someone is interested in my project, I would definitely want to save them the time in doing all of that cleaning, or let them come up with a better way to do so, so I want my data license to be simple and permissive. The only thing I want is credit for all of the time I spent doing this cleaning.
