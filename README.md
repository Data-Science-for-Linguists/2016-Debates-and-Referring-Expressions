Data in Debates is from [The American Presidency Project at UC Santa Barbara](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/debates.php) with citations below.

My uses for this data fall under the terms of fair use, as I am transforming them from their original transcript form and adding linguistic annotation and analysis for scholarship purposes. The transcripts of these debates can be found from other sources as well.
