I've created my project repo, downloaded the datasets I'll need for my analysis, and developed a project plan. I manually copied and pasted the debated transcripts into text files since there were only four of them. I began poking around the data that I have and realized I have some clean up to do.

#### Tasks
- Manually annotate for referring expressions
- Clean up extra data
  - annotations for who is speaking, applause, laughter, etc.
- Reformat text files so they're all uniform
- Decide whether to stick with just debates, or all speeches
