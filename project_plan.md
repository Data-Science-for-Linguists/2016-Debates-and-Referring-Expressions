## Gendered Name-calling in the 2016 US Election

This project will use transcriptions of the debates and speeches by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 Presidential Election, and do a linguistic analysis on the data regarding referring expressions. This document describes where I will be collecting data from, and how I will analyze this election discourse.

### Data
1) https://github.com/brendanmmcmanus/trump_speeches

Transcriptions of all of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's speeches from the beginning of the 2016 election to the end from Brendan McManus's GitHub. This dataset is a corpus of 130 transcriptions of speeches given by both candidates throughout the election as text files. These text files include some in-text annotations. I have not decided yet how/if I should use this extra information.

2) https://mega.nz/#F!uIwHnK4I!z0gBGy1E93Gs7sg_uO26vw

This is a collection of all of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's tweets from the end of the election period and onwards. The creator of this corpus wanted to use this data for author identification of tweets. This may or may not be used in my linguitic analysis, as tweets and formal speeches obviously have very significant stylistic differences.

3) http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/debates.php

The transcripts of all of the debates that occurred during this election can be found at this site. They are provided by The American Presidency Project at UC Santa Barbara. The data from this site has been scraped for Trump, and formatted to only include times he was speaking here:

I can scrape the site myself for Hillary's debates/reformat the Trump ones that already exist.

### Analysis
My end goal is to use this data to assess and pick out name-calling or gendered referring expressions in political speech to discuss some of the effects of this gendered language as a method of gaining power. It would also be interesting to look for repetition in the speeches and their levels of linguistic complexity. The paper "Politeness as a strategy of attack in a gendered political debate" by  Fracchiolla, B. (2011) looks at data from debates during the French presidential election with the first female candidate to make it to the debate round. That study looked at interruptions and gendered referring expressions. I plan to repeat a lot of this analysis myself with the US election data. I plan for some part of this project to involve manual annotation of the debates for referring expressions.
