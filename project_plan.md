## What Did You Call Me?
### Referring Expressions, Titles, and Name-calling in the 2016 US Election

This project will use transcriptions of the debates from the primary and general 2016 presidential election to do linguistic analysis on the speech of each participant regarding how they refer to their opponent(s). This document describes where I will be collecting data from, and how I will analyze this election discourse.

### Data

Source: [The American Presidency Project at UC Santa Barbara](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/debates.php)

The transcripts of all of the debates that occurred during this election can be found at this site. I have copied these transcriptions into text files and cleaned them into sentence tokenized documents where each sentence is annotated for named entities and labeled by speaker.

### Analysis
My end goal is to use this data to assess and pick out name-calling or gendered referring expressions in political speech to discuss some of the effects of this gendered language as a method of gaining power. It would also be interesting to look for repetition in the speeches and their levels of linguistic complexity. The paper "Politeness as a strategy of attack in a gendered political debate" by  Fracchiolla, B. (2011) looks at data from debates during the French presidential election with the first female candidate to make it to the debate round. That study looked at interruptions and gendered referring expressions. I plan to repeat a lot of this analysis myself with the US election data. I plan for some part of this project to involve manual annotation of the debates for referring expressions.
