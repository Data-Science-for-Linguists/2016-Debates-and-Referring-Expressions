2,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas."
3,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump."
4,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
5,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment."
6,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.
7,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic."
8,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates.
9,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent.
10,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say."
11,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump."
12,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"[applause]  Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome."
13,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Let's get right to it.
14,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,The first topic is the Supreme Court.
15,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments."
16,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century."
17,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country?"
18,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?"
19,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?
20,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first."
21,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You have two minutes.
22,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Thank you very much, Chris."
23,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.
24,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?"
25,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?
26,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,What kind of rights will Americans have?
27,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy."
28,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system."
29,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.
30,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us."
31,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans."
32,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And I look forward to having that opportunity.
33,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.
34,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.
35,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process."
36,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, thank you."
37,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, same question."
38,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Where do you want to see the court take the country?
39,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?
40,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody."
41,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.
42,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Our country is so, so—it's just so imperative that we have the right justices."
43,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent."
44,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And she was forced to apologize.
45,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And apologize she did.
46,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But these were statements that should never, ever have been made."
47,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege."
48,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now."
49,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma."
50,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint—and I've named 20 of them—the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.
51,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They will have a conservative bent.
52,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They will be protecting the Second Amendment.
53,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect."
54,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.
55,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And I believe that's very, very important."
56,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.
57,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"It's all about the Constitution of—of—and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be."
58,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And those are the people that I will appoint.
59,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, thank you."
60,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.
61,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land."
62,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns."
63,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment."""
64,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited."
65,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.
66,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,What's wrong with that?
67,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment."
68,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.
69,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I represented upstate New York.
70,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.
71,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,It goes back to the founding of our country.
72,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.
73,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family."
74,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns."
75,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole."
76,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.
77,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,You mentioned the Heller decision.
78,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them."
79,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others."
80,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.
81,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.
82,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got."
83,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?
84,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.
85,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?"
86,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly—and she was extremely angry about it."
87,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I watched.
88,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld."
89,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And Justice Scalia was so involved.
90,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And it was a well-crafted decision.
91,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry."
92,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.
93,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton."
94,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Were you extremely upset?
95,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions."
96,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms."
97,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation."
98,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA."
99,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,The gun lobby's on his side.
100,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.
101,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment."
102,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year."
103,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines."
104,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You support a national right to carry law.
105,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Why, sir?"
106,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, let me just tell you before we go any further."
107,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city."
108,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence."
109,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.
110,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And I am—I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA."
111,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.
112,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,So I'm very honored by all of that.
113,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We are going to appoint justices—this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.
114,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment."
115,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion."
116,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Right.

118,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes—in fact, states—a woman's right to abortion?"
119,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states."
120,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,But I'm asking you specifically.
121,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Would you like to...
122,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"If they overturned it, it will go back to the states."
123,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn—you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment."
124,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?
125,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be—that will happen."
126,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court."
127,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination."
128,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton?
129,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine."
130,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade."
131,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,It is about what's happening right now in America.
132,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country."
133,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.
134,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.
135,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I will defend Planned Parenthood.
136,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions."
137,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton...
138,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And we have come too far to have that turned back now.
139,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions."
140,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.
141,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes."
142,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.
143,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions."
144,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Why?
145,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.
146,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case."
147,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make."
148,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy."
149,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.
150,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.
151,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, your reaction?"
152,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions."
153,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, I think it's terrible."
154,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby."
155,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK."
156,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day."
157,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And that's not acceptable.
158,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, that is not what happens in these cases."
159,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.
160,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life."
161,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.
162,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And I do not believe the government should be making it.
163,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country."
164,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania."
165,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice."
166,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And I will stand up for that right.
167,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,All right.
168,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment..."
169,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth."
170,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Nobody has that.
171,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,All right.
172,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Let's move on to the subject of immigration.
173,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration.
174,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you."
175,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall."
176,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border."
177,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations."
178,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship."
179,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?"
180,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment."
181,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You have two minutes.
182,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years."
183,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We need strong borders.
184,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of—I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally."
185,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.
186,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They're coming in illegally.
187,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Drugs are pouring in through the border.
188,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We have no country if we have no border.
189,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Hillary wants to give amnesty.
190,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She wants to have open borders.
191,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"The border—as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me."
192,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.
193,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It means their job is tougher.
194,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But they know what's going on.
195,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They know it better than anybody.
196,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They want strong borders.
197,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They feel we have to have strong borders.
198,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I was up in New Hampshire the other day.
199,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"The biggest complaint they have—it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama."
200,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,All of the problems—the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.
201,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's just pouring and destroying their youth.
202,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.
203,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We have to have strong borders.
204,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We have to keep the drugs out of our country.
205,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We are—right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash."
206,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We need strong borders.
207,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We need absolute—we cannot give amnesty.
208,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Now, I want to build the wall."
209,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We need the wall.
210,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall."
211,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We stop the drugs.
212,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We shore up the border.
213,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones—we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out."
214,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.
215,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest."
216,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out."
217,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, thank you."
218,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Same question to you, Secretary Clinton."
219,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?"
220,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not."
221,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life."
222,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And you're right.
223,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I don't want to rip families apart.
224,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I don't want to be sending parents away from children.
225,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.
226,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We have 11 million undocumented people.
227,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people."
228,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.
229,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Now, here's what that means."
230,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented."
231,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country."
232,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.
233,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.
234,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I have been for border security for years.
235,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I voted for border security in the United States Senate.
236,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.
237,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.
238,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them."
239,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president."
240,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Didn't even raise it.
241,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.
242,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.
243,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.

247,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,OK.
248,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I think I should respond to that.
249,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico."
250,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Very nice man.
251,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.
252,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Believe me.
253,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody."
254,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's a disaster.
255,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
256,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.
257,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built."
258,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.
259,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Well, let me—wait, wait, sir, let me..."
260,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We are a country of laws.
261,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We either have—and by the way...
262,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Now, wait."
263,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,I'd like to hear from...
264,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well—well, but she said one thing."
265,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,I'd like to hear—I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.
266,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I voted for border security, and there are..."
267,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And the wall.
268,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,There are some limited places where that was appropriate.
269,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.
270,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants."
271,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages."
272,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And Donald knows a lot about this.
273,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.
274,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported."""
275,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers."
276,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Mr. Trump?
277,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,President Obama has moved millions of people out.
278,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it."
279,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country."
280,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They've been deported.
281,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league."
282,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,As far as moving these people out and moving—we either have a country or we don't.
283,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We're a country of laws.
284,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We either have a border or we don't.
285,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen."
286,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But it's very unfair.
287,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We have millions of people that did it the right way.
288,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They're on line.
289,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They're waiting.
290,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient."
291,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.
292,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders."
293,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders."
294,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,I want to...
295,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.
296,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, I want to..."
297,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We will not have open borders.
298,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That is...
299,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Well, let me—Secretary..."
300,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That is a rank mischaracterization.
301,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton...
302,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform."
303,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And this used to be a bipartisan issue.
304,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Ronald Reagan was the last president...

308,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote."

311,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Thank you.
312,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,That's the question.

314,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Is that your dream, open borders?"
315,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy."
316,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined."

318,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I think that would be a great benefit to us.
319,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks.
320,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.
321,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions."
322,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.
323,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election."
324,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?"
325,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Those are the questions we need answered.
326,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.

329,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,How did we get on to Putin?

332,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Because we—this is going to end up getting out of control.

334,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,So just to finish on the borders...
335,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Yes?
336,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She wants open borders.
337,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,People are going to pour into our country.
338,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,People are going to come in from Syria.

343,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders."
344,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Now we can talk about Putin.
345,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I don't know Putin.
346,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,He said nice things about me.

352,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And she's playing chicken.

360,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You're the puppet!
361,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,It's pretty clear you won't admit...
362,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"No, you're the puppet."
363,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race."
364,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.
365,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.
366,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"We have 17—17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election."
367,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I find that deeply disturbing.
368,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton...
369,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And I think it's time you take a stand...
370,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else."
371,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I am not quoting myself.
372,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She has no idea.

375,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,... 17 intelligence—do you doubt 17 military and civilian...
376,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And our country has no idea.

378,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Yeah, I doubt it."
379,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I doubt it.
380,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us."
381,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I find that just absolutely...[crosstalk]
382,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.
383,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Mr. Trump...
384,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Excuse me.
385,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.
386,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Mr. Trump...[crosstalk]
387,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,He's outsmarted her every step of the way.
388,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,I do get to ask some questions.
389,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Yes, that's fine."
390,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,And I would like to ask you this direct question.
391,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks.
392,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?"
393,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,By Russia or anybody else.
394,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You condemn their interference?
395,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Of course I condemn.
396,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Of course I—I don't know Putin.
397,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I have no idea.
398,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,I'm not asking—I'm asking do you condemn?
399,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I never met Putin.
400,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,This is not my best friend.
401,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad."
402,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way."
403,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Whether it's Syria, you name it."
404,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Missiles.
405,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed."
406,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this."
407,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"They create warheads, and we can't."
408,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,The Russians can't believe it.
409,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She has been outsmarted by Putin.
410,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.
411,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They've taken over.
412,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We've spent $6 trillion.
413,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They've taken over the Middle East.
414,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.
415,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic."
416,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You got about 45 seconds.
417,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And she always will be.
418,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I—I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.
419,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons."
420,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He's...
421,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Wrong.
422,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia."
423,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying."
424,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But here's the deal.
425,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed."
426,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
427,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button."
428,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I have 200 generals...
429,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Very quickly.
430,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients."
431,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the—we're defending other countries."
432,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We are spending a fortune doing it.
433,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They have the bargain of the century.
434,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places."
435,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We cannot continue to afford—she took that as saying nuclear weapons.
436,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,OK.
437,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways."
438,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,This is just another lie.
439,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked..."
440,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,There's no quote.
441,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You're not going to find a quote from me.
442,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"... about a potential nuclear—nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks."
443,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That kind...
444,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And defend yourselves.
445,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,... of language—well...
446,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And defend yourselves.
447,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I didn't say nuclear.
448,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And defend yourself.
449,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,The United States has kept the peace—the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.
450,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Donald wants to tear up our alliances.
451,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer."
452,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere."
453,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.
454,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"We're going to—no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy."
455,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration.
456,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.
457,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role."
458,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties."
459,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation."
460,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Yes.
461,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,We're going to drill down into this a little bit more.
462,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not."
463,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton."
464,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives."
465,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities."
466,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing."
467,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should."
468,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses."
469,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I want us to do more to help small business.
470,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.
471,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not—who work full-time should not still be in poverty."
472,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.
473,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.
474,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future."
475,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted."
476,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is."
477,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.
478,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.
479,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.
480,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.
481,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs."
482,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Why?
483,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids."
484,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.
485,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.

487,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?"
488,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes."
489,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Her tax plan is a disaster.
490,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And she can say all she wants about college tuition.
491,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And I'm a big proponent.
492,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.
493,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.
494,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan."
495,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm—not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries."
496,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Saudi Arabia, nothing but money."
497,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We protect Saudi Arabia.
498,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Why aren't they paying?
499,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"She immediately—when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO."
500,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Why aren't the NATO questioned—why aren't they paying?
501,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Because they weren't paying.
502,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Since I did this—this was a year ago—all of a sudden, they're paying."
503,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And I've been given a lot—a lot of credit for it.
504,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up."
505,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They have to pay up.
506,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We're protecting people, they have to pay up."
507,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And I'm a big fan of NATO.
508,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But they have to pay up.
509,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great."
510,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are."
511,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out."

513,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We're up to $20 trillion.
514,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,So my plan—we're going to renegotiate trade deals.
515,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We're going to have a lot of free trade.
516,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now."
517,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But we have horrible deals.
518,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever."
519,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.
520,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them."
521,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You go upstate New York.
522,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.
523,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We're bringing our jobs back.
524,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.
525,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And if I can't make a great deal—then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.
526,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We're going to have trade, but we're going—we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal."
527,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And if we can't, we're going to do it—we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster."
528,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We are going to cut taxes massively.
529,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We're going to cut business taxes massively.
530,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They're going to start hiring people.
531,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...

535,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Mr. Trump?
536,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP."
537,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because..."
538,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You can't.
539,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration."
540,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less."
541,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I also will not add a penny to the debt.
542,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I have costed out what I'm going to do.
543,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt."
544,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, he mentioned the debt."
545,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We know how to get control of the debt.
546,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt."
547,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression."
548,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.
549,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people."
550,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead."
551,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That's the kind of approach that will work.
552,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Secretary...
553,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that."
554,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,It has not worked the way that it has been promised.
555,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949."
556,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Correct.
557,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Thank you, sir."
558,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus.
559,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,So is your plan basically more—even more of the Obama stimulus?
560,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, it's a combination, Chris."
561,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation."
562,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.
563,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.
564,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.
565,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.
566,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But it was a terrible recession.
567,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running."
568,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down."
569,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That is not going to work.
570,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs."
571,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs."
572,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do."
573,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent..."
574,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Over a 10-year period.
575,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,... growth is unrealistic.
576,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,And they say—you talk a lot about growing the energy industry.
577,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well."
578,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Your response, sir?"
579,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,So I just left some high representatives of India.
580,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They're growing at 8 percent.
581,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,China is growing at 7 percent.
582,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And that for them is a catastrophically low number.
583,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We are growing—our last report came out—and it's right around the 1 percent level.
584,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And I think it's going down.
585,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report."
586,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,A terrible jobs report.
587,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?"
588,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad."
589,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,The report was so bad.
590,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Look, our country is stagnant."
591,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We've lost our jobs.
592,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We've lost our businesses.
593,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking."
594,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world."
595,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I've visited so many communities.
596,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris."
597,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I've gotten to know so many—I've developed so many friends over the last year.
598,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And they cry when they see what's happened.
599,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities."
600,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left."
601,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Boy, did they suffer."
602,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.

604,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And she wants it.
605,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.
606,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She totally lied.
607,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She did call it the gold standard.
608,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right."
609,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I was so honored.

613,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"But go ahead, briefly."
614,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it."
615,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,It didn't meet my test.
616,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I've had the same test.
617,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?"
618,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I'm against it now.
619,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I'll be against it after the election.
620,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I'll be against it when I'm president.
621,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald."
622,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico."
623,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But he mentioned China.
624,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets."
625,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I have fought against that as a senator.
626,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I've stood up against it as secretary of state.
627,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.
628,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel."
629,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers."
630,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Mr. Trump?
631,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.
632,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, let me just say—let me just say."
633,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We're going to pull the country together.
634,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.
635,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.
636,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products."

639,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Let me ask a simple question.
640,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She's been doing this for 30 years.
641,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?"
642,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"No, I voted."
643,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You were very much involved—excuse me.
644,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,My turn.
645,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.
646,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Very much.
647,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And you do have experience.
648,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly."
649,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I—make it impossible for me to do that."
650,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I wouldn't mind.
651,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary."
652,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You don't.
653,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing."
654,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,How do you miss $6 billion?
655,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen."
656,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They don't know.
657,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"It's gone, $6 billion."
658,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess."
659,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Believe me.
660,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times."
661,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But I think it's really an important issue.
662,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that."
663,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund."
664,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.
665,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.

670,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Give me a break.
671,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice."""
672,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision."
673,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, I think I did a much better job."
674,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars."
675,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I started with a $1 million loan.
676,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I agree with that.
677,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's a $1 million loan.
678,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But I built a phenomenal company.
679,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of."
680,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You would even be proud of it.
681,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria."
682,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Take a look at the migration.
683,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Take a look at Libya.
684,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Take a look at Iraq.
685,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when—we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out."
686,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.
687,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.
688,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.
689,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She's going to get rid of nobody.
690,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,All right.
691,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States."

693,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent."
694,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up—you deny this—why would they all make up these stories?"
695,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse."

697,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked."
698,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Those people—I don't know those people.
699,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I have a feeling how they came.
700,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I believe it was her campaign that did it.
701,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?
702,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.
703,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"They hired people—they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things."
704,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I would say the only way—because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that."
705,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything."
706,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I didn't know any of these—I didn't see these women.
707,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"These women—the woman on the plane, the—I think they want either fame or her campaign did it."
708,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And I think it's her campaign.
709,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence."
710,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot."
711,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And that was now all on tape, started by her."
712,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward."
713,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame."
714,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But they were all totally—it was all fiction.
715,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"It was lies, and it was fiction."
716,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Well...

720,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Now, what was his response?"
721,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted."
722,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I did not say that.
723,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I did not say that.

727,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I did not say that.
728,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,It's her two minutes.
729,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He went on to say, ""Look at her."
730,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I don't think so."""
731,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice."""
732,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign."
733,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.
734,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like."
735,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.
736,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That's who Donald is.
737,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater."
738,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"America is great, because America is good."

741,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Nobody has more respect for women than I do.
742,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Nobody.
743,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,[laughter]  Nobody has more respect...
744,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Please, everybody."
745,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked."
746,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.
747,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign."
748,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress."
749,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"What happened to the FBI, I don't know."
750,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI."
751,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,One lie.
752,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI."
753,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,He's going to probably go to jail.
754,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,This is a four-star general.
755,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?"
756,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign."
757,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton?
758,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility."
759,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And it's not just about women.
760,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.
761,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.
762,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television."
763,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Wrong.
764,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion."
765,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers ""people who aren't captured."""
766,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican."
767,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So it's not one thing.
768,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies."
769,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That is not who America is.
770,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election."
771,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.
772,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence."
773,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's on tape.
774,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,During the last...

776,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,OK.
777,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"... but those other charges, as she knows, are false."
778,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate."
779,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,I'd like to ask you about them.
780,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,These are questions that the American people have.
781,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you."
782,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money."
783,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee?
784,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?"
785,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values."
786,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,The State Department has said that.
787,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I think that's been proven.
788,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does."
789,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate—I know I don't have the time to do that."
790,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment."
791,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,In partnership with the American Health Association...

795,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, it is an open discussion."
796,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And you...
797,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,And the specific question went to pay for play.
798,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Do you want to talk about that?
799,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, but there is no—but there is no evidence—but there is...[crosstalk]"

802,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...
803,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's been very well studied.
804,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,... and the high rankings...[crosstalk]
805,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Please let Mr. Trump speak.

809,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's a criminal enterprise.
810,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries."
811,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You talk about women and women's rights?
812,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,So these are people that push gays off business—off buildings.
813,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.
814,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And yet you take their money.
815,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?"
816,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Why don't you give back the money?
817,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I think it would be a great gesture.
818,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.
819,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And you take a look at the people of Haiti.
820,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.
821,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace."
822,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it."
823,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton?
824,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent—90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country."
825,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I'm very proud of that.
826,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.
827,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald."
828,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I mean, who does that?"
829,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,It just was astonishing.
830,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere."

832,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.
833,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.
834,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else."
835,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...
836,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,All right.
837,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,... because it's an important part of the American experience.
838,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They don't want you to help them anymore.

840,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I'd like to mention one thing.

847,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,What happens—the money goes to them.
848,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?"
849,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"No, it was—we put up the American flag."
850,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And that's it.
851,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They put up the American flag.
852,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.
853,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Right.
854,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation..."
855,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,There was.
856,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,There was.
857,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And, by the way..."
858,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"... instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir."
859,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"... the money—the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses—the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets."
860,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,I want to get into one...
861,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns."
862,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it."
863,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,You can look at our tax returns.
864,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We've got them all out there.
865,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.
866,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris."
867,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"You know, half of all immigrants—undocumented immigrants in our country—actually pay federal income tax."
868,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.
869,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I find that just astonishing.
870,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,I want...
871,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it."
872,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And all of her donors—just about all of them—I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars..."

874,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Let me just explain.
875,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"But, no, we heard this..."
876,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.

882,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so."
883,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, you know..."
884,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You should have changed the law.
885,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money."
886,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump..."
887,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Made with Chinese steel.
888,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But I will tell you, I sat there...[laughter]..."
889,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad."
890,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.
891,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And, frankly, you should have changed the laws."
892,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Mr. Trump...
893,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws."
894,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic."
895,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.
896,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you—his words—""will absolutely accept the result of this election."""
897,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing."

899,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I will look at it at the time.
900,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I'm not looking at anything now.
901,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I'll look at it at the time.
902,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,What I've seen—what I've seen is so bad.
903,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing."
904,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care."
905,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's so dishonest.
906,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.
907,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it."
908,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I think they're going to see through it.
909,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We'll find out on November 8th.
910,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But I think they're going to see through it.
911,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"But, sir, there's..."
912,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"If you look—excuse me, Chris—if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote—millions, this isn't coming from me—this is coming from Pew Report and other places—millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote."
913,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,So let me just give you one other thing.
914,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,So I talk about the corrupt media.
915,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I talk about the millions of people—tell you one other thing.
916,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She shouldn't be allowed to run.
917,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"It's crooked—she's—she's guilty of a very, very serious crime."
918,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,She should not be allowed to run.
919,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never..."
920,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,But...
921,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things."
922,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"But, sir, there is a tradition in this country—in fact, one of the prides of this country—is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner."
923,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country."
924,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?
925,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.
926,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I'll keep you in suspense.
927,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,OK?
928,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying."
929,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him."
930,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.
931,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.
932,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He lost the Iowa caucus.
933,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He lost the Wisconsin primary.
934,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.
935,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.
936,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.
937,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Should have gotten it.
938,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,[laughter]
939,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,This is—this is a mindset.
940,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,This is how Donald thinks.
941,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And it's funny, but it's also really troubling."
942,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,OK.
943,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So that is not the way our democracy works.
944,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We've been around for 240 years.
945,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We've had free and fair elections.
946,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.
947,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.

952,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.
953,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And let's—you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means."
954,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He is denigrating—he's talking down our democracy.
955,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position."
956,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful."
957,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I think it's a disgrace.
958,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,All right.
959,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.

962,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,This doesn't do any good for anyone.

964,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun.
965,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after?"
966,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,And that's something that whichever of you ends up—whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.
967,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse?

969,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You have two minutes.
970,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground."
971,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.
972,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do."
973,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself."
974,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,The goal here is to take back Mosul.
975,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,It's going to be a hard fight.
976,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I've got no illusions about that.
977,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters."
978,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real—a really successful military operation.
979,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But we know we've got lots of work to do.
980,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue."
981,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS."
982,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons."
983,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun."
984,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track."
985,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, same question."
986,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will—would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?"
987,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad."
988,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We had Mosul.
989,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul."
990,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.
991,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.
992,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul."
993,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?"
994,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We announce we're going after Mosul.
995,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about—how long is it, Hillary, three months?"
996,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,These people have all left.
997,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They've all left.
998,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,The element of surprise.
999,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country."
1000,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had."
1001,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it."
1002,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?
1003,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.
1004,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They want to look good.
1005,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes."
1006,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,That's why we have the great migration.
1007,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But she wanted to look good for the election.
1008,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,So they're going in.
1009,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But who's going to get Mosul, really?"
1010,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We'll take Mosul eventually.
1011,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But the way—if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought."
1012,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Much, much tougher."
1013,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Much more dangerous.
1014,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Going to be more deaths that they thought.
1015,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.
1016,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"They say, what do we need this for?"
1017,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.
1018,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid—the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons."
1019,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them."
1020,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,So we're now going to take Mosul.
1021,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?
1022,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Iran.
1023,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Oh, yeah, they're making—I mean, they are outsmarting—look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision."
1024,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.
1025,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it."
1026,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way."
1027,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Sir, your two minutes are up."
1028,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran."
1029,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq."
1030,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I said it was a mistake.
1031,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I've said that years ago.
1032,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He has consistently denied what is...
1033,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Wrong.
1034,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,... a very clear fact that...
1035,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Wrong.
1036,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"... before the invasion, he supported it."
1037,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it."
1038,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Google ""Donald Trump Iraq."""
1039,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.
1040,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Wrong.
1041,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.
1042,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Now, why does that matter?"
1043,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position."
1044,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.
1045,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.
1046,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Mosul is a Sunni city.
1047,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,Mosul is on the border of Syria.
1048,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and—just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice."
1049,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We need to go after the leadership.
1050,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters."
1051,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.
1052,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,They've been digging underground.
1053,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,They've been prepared to defend.
1054,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,It's going to be tough fighting.
1055,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa."
1056,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,This is what we have to do.
1057,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks."
1058,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy."
1059,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Chris, we don't gain anything."

1068,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He says...[crosstalk]

1071,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks."
1072,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"No, you are the one that's unfit."
1073,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out—John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right."
1074,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,He said some beauties.
1075,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment."
1076,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,You do.
1077,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted—the leaders—they're all gone."
1078,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"If you think that was good, then you do."
1079,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts."
1080,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.
1081,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I agree with both.
1082,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president."
1083,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And he has said...
1084,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Which is a big mistake.
1085,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America."
1086,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I think he's right.
1087,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Let's turn to Aleppo.

1090,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,You said that Aleppo has basically fallen.

1100,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?

1102,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"OK, so it hasn't fallen."
1103,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Take a look at it.
1104,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered."
1105,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,That's right.
1106,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And they are being slaughtered...
1107,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Yes.
1108,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,... because of bad decisions.

1112,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, Aleppo is a disaster."
1113,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's a humanitarian nightmare.
1114,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But it has fallen from the—from any standpoint.
1115,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I mean, what do you need, a signed document?"
1116,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Take a look at Aleppo.
1117,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It is so sad when you see what's happened.
1118,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's—he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama."
1119,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago."
1120,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,He—he aligned with Russia.
1121,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful."
1122,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We gave them $150 billion back.
1123,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We give them $1.7 billion in cash.
1124,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"I mean, cash."
1125,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Bundles of cash as big as this stage.
1126,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We gave them $1.7 billion.
1127,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Now they have—he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.
1128,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing—we're backing rebels."
1129,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We don't know who the rebels are.
1130,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything."
1131,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We don't know who the rebels are.
1132,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And when and if—and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now."
1133,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with—as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad."
1134,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape."
1135,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases—not probably, who are definitely..."

1138,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.
1139,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Lots of luck, Hillary."
1140,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Thanks a lot for doing a great job.
1141,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Secretary Clinton, you have talked about—and in the last debate and again today—that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there."
1142,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.
1143,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war—his words—with Syria and Russia."
1144,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone—first of all, how do you respond to their concerns?"
1145,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?"
1146,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict."
1147,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.
1148,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,This would not be done just on the first day.
1149,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,This would take a lot of negotiation.
1150,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.
1151,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.
1152,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS."
1153,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.
1154,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He's made these claims repeatedly.
1155,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in."
1156,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.
1157,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting."
1158,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting."
1159,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks."
1160,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born."
1161,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.
1162,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home."
1163,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Folks, I want to get into our final segment."
1164,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But I just have to...
1165,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Real quick.
1166,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's so ridiculous what she—she will defeat ISIS.
1167,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.
1168,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And right now, they're in 32 countries."
1169,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,OK.
1170,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We should have—wait one second.
1171,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.
1172,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria."
1173,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore."
1174,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires."
1175,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,They are outplayed.
1176,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Now, she wasn't there."
1177,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I assume she had nothing to do with it.
1178,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way—and by Iran."
1179,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.
1180,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton—no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight."
1181,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent."
1182,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,That's the highest since just after World War II.
1183,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years."
1184,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years."
1185,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem?"
1186,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Mr. Trump, you go first."
1187,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs."
1188,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero."
1189,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.
1190,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.
1191,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.
1192,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine."
1193,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.
1194,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"To do that, we're taking back jobs."
1195,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore."
1196,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's very sad.
1197,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But I'm going to create a—the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.
1198,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We used to be there.
1199,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We've given it up.
1200,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"We've become very, very sloppy."

1203,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But we don't use those people.
1204,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Those are the people—these are the greatest negotiators in the world.
1205,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.
1206,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.
1207,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We use political hacks.
1208,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We use people that get the position because they gave—they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.
1209,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,So we have to use our great people.
1210,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades."
1211,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money."
1212,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.
1213,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton?
1214,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great."
1215,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades."
1216,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world."
1217,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,He was criticizing President Reagan.
1218,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage."
1219,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing."
1220,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I do not add a penny to the national debt.
1221,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with."
1222,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is."
1223,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.
1224,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.
1225,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"In fact, I think just the opposite."
1226,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.
1227,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America."
1228,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That's where growth will come from.
1229,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That's why I want to invest in you.
1230,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I want to invest in your family.
1231,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer."
1232,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And we just have a big disagreement about this.
1233,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,It may be because of our experiences.
1234,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire..."
1235,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Yeah, yeah, we've heard—we've heard this before, Hillary."
1236,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I started off with—my dad was a small-business man.
1237,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We've heard this before.
1238,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And I think it—you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy."
1239,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,Time.
1240,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"Thank you, Hillary."
1241,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Could I just respond?
1242,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time..."
1243,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.
1244,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I disagreed with him.
1245,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We should have been much tougher on trade even then.
1246,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I've been waiting for years.
1247,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Nobody does it right.
1248,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,OK.
1249,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And frankly, now we're going to do it right."
1250,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,All right.
1251,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending."
1252,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Now, the Committee for federal—a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits."
1253,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is—and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?"
1254,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,I'm cutting taxes.
1255,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We're going to grow the economy.
1256,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.
1257,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,That's not going to help in the entitlements.
1258,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"No, it's going to totally help you."
1259,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.
1260,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,It's destroying our country.
1261,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses."
1262,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.
1263,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster."
1264,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"If we don't repeal and replace—now, it's probably going to die of its own weight."
1265,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,But Obamacare has to go.
1266,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"It's—the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent."
1267,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.
1268,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,"And I'm really glad that the premiums have started—at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse."
1269,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Bad health care at the most expensive price.
1270,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.
1271,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money."
1272,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,WALLACE,"Will you as president entertain—will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?"
1273,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund."
1274,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.
1275,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it."
1276,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...
1277,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Such a nasty woman.
1278,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it."
1279,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I will not cut benefits.
1280,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.
1281,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.
1282,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.
1283,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal."
1284,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.
1285,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,"So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse."
1286,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,What we need to do is go after...
1287,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,TRUMP,Your husband disagrees with you.
1288,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,... the long-term health care drivers.

1290,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,I have a plan for doing that.
1291,University of Nevada in Las Vegas,10/19/16,3,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119039,CLINTON,And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.
