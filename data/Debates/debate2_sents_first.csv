242,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.,
243,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,"After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all‰ÛÓanyone who says otherwise has no basis‰ÛÓthat any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.",

329,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,"And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.",
330,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,Premiums have gotten too high.,
331,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,"Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.",
332,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,"But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.",
333,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,But that in and of itself was a good thing.,
334,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,"I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.",
335,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,"But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.",

338,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,"Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.",
339,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,"Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.",
340,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.,
341,"Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri",10/9/16,2,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=119038,CLINTON,But we've got to get costs down.,
