25,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,HOLT,And central to that is jobs.,
26,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,HOLT,There are two economic realities in America today.,

31,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.,
32,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.",
33,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.",
34,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.",

37,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.",
38,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,We also have to make the economy fairer.,
39,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.",
40,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.,
41,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.",
42,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.,
43,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.,
44,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.",

47,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.,

59,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,They're going to many other countries.,
60,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.,
61,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,"They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.",
62,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,And we have a very good fight.,
63,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,And we have a winning fight.,
64,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,"Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.",
65,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,"So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.",
66,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,"When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.",
67,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,"They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.",
68,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,"With the United States, as he said, not so much.",
69,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,So Ford is leaving.,

73,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,And we can't allow it to happen anymore.,

75,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,"We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.",
76,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.,
77,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,"We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.",

81,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.,
82,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,We cannot let it happen.,
83,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,"Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.",
84,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.,
85,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.,

94,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.",
95,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.",
96,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.",
97,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.,Donald
98,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.",
99,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.",
100,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,That is not how we grow the economy.,
101,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.",
102,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.,
103,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,I understand that.,
104,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.",Donald

106,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,I don't buy that.,
107,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,I have a different experience.,
108,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,My father was a small-businessman.,
109,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,He worked really hard.,
110,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.",
111,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.",
112,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.,

475,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,HOLT,But let me just admonish the audience one more time.,
476,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,HOLT,There was an agreement.,
477,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,HOLT,"We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.",
478,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,HOLT,Secretary Clinton?,Secretary Clinton
479,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.",
480,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.",
481,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.",
482,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.,
483,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?",
484,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,And I think there may be a couple of reasons.,
485,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.",
486,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.",
487,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.",
488,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.",
489,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,TRUMP,That makes me smart.,
490,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.",
491,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.",
492,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.",
493,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.,
494,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.,
495,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.",
496,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,And we'll guess.,
497,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.,
498,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?",
499,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,Who does he owe money to?,
500,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,"Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.",
501,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,HOLT,He alsoâ€”he also raised the issue of your e-mails.,

706,"Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York",9/26/16,1,http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=118971,CLINTON,So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.,
